<h2>Grudge Melter</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your doggy is dreaming, help them recall their good memories and not their bad ones to maximize their mental health.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience should be fun, quick, and something you want to play again.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
In this game, players have to help their doggy navigate dreamworld by recalling good memories, not bad ones. <br><img src='assets/img/dog.png'>
Players can jump and/or fly using the up arrow key, and move left and right using the respective arrow keys.
Players should aim to collect good memories, represented as sunny clouds. <img src='assets/img/cloud.png' alt='good memory cloud'>
Players should try to avoid hitting bad memories, represented as rainclouds. <img src='assets/img/raincloud.png' alt='bad memory cloud'>
The goal is to collect all the good memories, while keeping your doggy's mental health above zero. Each good memory collected boosts mental health by 3, while bad memories decrease mental health by 5. The game starts with 10 mental health points and ends in failure if you reach 0. The maximum number of mental health points you can achieve is 28.
<br>
System dynamics: The good clouds fall and bounce, while bad clouds have randomly generated positions. Every time a bad cloud is hit, in addition to decreading mental health, a new bad cloud is generated and randomly placed. The dog is able to jump and fly, controlled by the player, in order to maximize health and win.<br>
Core mechanic: The players repeatedly fly.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype evaluates the ability to jump into flight. Defying gravity is part of the dream world.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because it is simple, but because the bad clouds are generated randomly, some instances are much harder to get out of than others.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main character, the player's doggy, is dreaming. In this dream, he can recall good and bad memories. The player's goal is to help him navigate his dream world, avoiding bad memories (represented as rain clouds) and collecting good memories (represented as sunny clouds) in order to help the doggy's mental health.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game does not have an storyline.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers who want to play something for fun.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2 minutes or less.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Understanding the controls, utilizing jump/flying, and taking your time.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the images from scratch.<br>

<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example. I did use Phaser documentation and many examples for many small parts of the game, such as learning how to set keypad controls.
