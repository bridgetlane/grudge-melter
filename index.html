<h2>Grudge Melter</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate the maze as a policeman, battling grudges by collecting slime and shooting it at the grudges to reveal their true love for you!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience should be fun, quick, and something you want to play again.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players can use L/R/U/D arrow keys to navigate the maze. They will automatically pick up slime when they hit it, which will load them up with more firepower! Each slime collected will give the player 4 more shots of firepower.
<br>Players use the slime collected to shoot slime at the grudges. There are 15 grudges that have to be "converted" (upon hitting a grudge, the player will see a heart, signifying the grudge is no more). In order to kill a grudge, the player can shoot slime using the spacebar. It will shoot in the direction of the mouse.
<br>Players are confined to the bounds of the maze.
<br>Players die if they run into a grudge. Players have 3 lives, and lose after all lives are lost.
<br>
System dynamics: The grudges are placed semi-randomly and able to be hit by the slime the player shoots.<br>
Core mechanic: The player can move semi-freely.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores the ability to move within the confines of a maze.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because while players are confined to the maze, their ammo isn't.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player plays as a policeman. This policeman has to fight off a lot of things with grudges. These grudges melt when hit with slime.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game does not have an storyline.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers and explorers who want to play something for fun.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
5 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Understanding the controls, remembering the maze.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The tilemap was created by me using Tiled.
<br><br>The tilesheet and sprite are from the Platformer Art Deluxe pack, an uncopyrighted tileset that can be found here http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-deluxe

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example. I did use Phaser documentation and many examples for many small parts of the game, such as learning how to set keypad controls.
